# Find e to the Nth Digit

## Description

Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI. Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

## Notes

- You need math background here.
- You must face infinity, as is irrational
- You can use approximate method or calculate by definition
